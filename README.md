## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/genesis-particle-life-simulator.git
   ```

2. Install the raylib framework by following the instructions in the [raylib GitHub repository](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).

3. Build and run the simulator using a C++ compiler and the raylib library.

## Usage

1. Launch the simulator.

2. Adjust the sliders to modify the forces and parameters of each particle group.

3. Interact with the simulation using the following controls:

   - Arrow keys: Move the camera in different directions.
   - Mouse wheel: Zoom in and out.
   - R key: Reset the camera position.
   - Quit button: Exit the simulation.
   - Show Lines button: Toggle the visibility of force lines between particles.
   - Randomize button: Randomize the forces applied to particle groups.

4. Observe the captivating behaviors and interactions of the particles as the simulation progresses.
